# Javascript Quiz App

### Project Description

Create a dynamic and interactive JavaScript quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches questions from an API based on user-selected options. The app will consist of three major screens to provide a seamless quiz-taking experience.

### Requirements:

**Screen 1 - Quiz Options:**

- This screen will allow the user to customize the quiz settings.
- Provide input fields or dropdowns to select the number of questions, quiz category, type (multiple-choice, true/false), and difficulty level.
- Include a "Start Quiz" button to move to the next screen.

**Screen 2 - Quiz Questions:**

- This screen will display the quiz questions, options, and scoring features.
- Fetch questions from the API based on the user's selected options.
- Display the current question number out of the total selected questions.
- Present the question and multiple-choice options.
- Include a "Next Question" button to move to the next question.
- Show a "Quit Quiz" button to end the quiz and display the final score.
- Implement a real-time scoring system where the user earns points for each correct answer.
- If the user selects a correct option, mark it as green, and update the score.
- If the user selects a wrong option, mark it as red and display the correct answer at the bottom.
- Store the user's total score for the quiz.

**Screen 3 - Quiz Results:**

- This screen will display the final quiz results.
- Show the user's total score achieved in the quiz.
- Include a "Play New Quiz" button to start a new quiz with different options.

### Submission

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your cloned project repository.

3. Check the current status of your repository by running the following command:
   </br>
   `git status`

4. Add any modified or new files to the staging area by executing the following command:
   </br>
   `git add .`
   </br>
   This will stage all the changes in your project directory for the commit.

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message using the following command:
   </br>
   `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

6. Push your code to the remote repository using the following command:
   </br>
   `git push origin main`

7. Go to your repository on GitHub.

8. Click on the "Settings" tab.

9. Scroll to the "Code and automation > Pages" section.

10. Under "Source", select the branch you pushed your changes to (e.g., main).

11. Click on "Save" or "Update".

12. GitHub Pages will now build and deploy your project. Once the deployment is complete, you will see a green success message with the URL of your deployed assignment.

13. Access your hosted assignment by visiting the provided URL. Please note that it may take a few minutes for your changes to propagate and for the site to be accessible.

**Note**: Ensure that your project includes an index.html file at the root of the repository or in the specified deployment folder. This will serve as the entry point for your GitHub Pages site.
